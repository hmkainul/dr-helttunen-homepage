## Congratulations to Evgeny
<Calendar/> January 2022

Our former post-doctoral researcher Dr. Evgeny Bulatov has received an [I2:ICIQ Impulsion fellowship](http://iciq-impulsion.eu/impulsions-3th-call-fellowships-awarded/) for "Resorcin[4]arene and Calix[4]pyrrole Based Cavitands in Asymmetric Supramolecular Gold(I) Catalysis". He has now joined Prof. Pau Ballester and Prof. Antonio M. Echavarren research groups at the Institute of Chemical Research of Catalonia.

## Paper published in ACS Omega
<Calendar/> September 2021

Emilia J. Virtanen, Siiri Perämäki, Kaisa Helttunen, Ari Väisänen, Jani O. Moilanen, [Alkyl-substituted aminobis(phosphonates) - efficient precipitating agents for rare earth elements, thorium, and uranium in aqueous solutions](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.1c02982)

This study reports six simple water-soluble aminobis(phosphonate) ligands, which separate selectively thorium, uranium, and scandium from rare earth elements with improved separation factors in comparison to traditional oxalate precipitation agents. The aminobis(phosphonate) ligands were found to form Y, La and Lu metal complexes with fewer ligands than traditional separation agents like DEHPA, thus requiring less precipitation agent.

## New Post-doctoral researcher

<Calendar/> September 2020

Dr. Evgeny Bulatov has joined the team. His project includes synthesis, crystallography and applications of calix[4]pyrrole based anion receptors.

## First paper accepted in Chemistry - A European Journal

<Calendar/> February 2020

Małgorzata Pamuła, Maija Nissinen, Kaisa Helttunen, [Correlating solution- and solid-state structures of conformationally flexible resorcinarenes: significance of a sulfonyl group in intramolecular self‐inclusion](https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.201905211)

<Portrait src="17.png" alt="Chem. Eur. J. 2020" />

In this paper we show that a conformationally flexible resorcinarene macrocycle forms a self-inclusion complex in the solid state and adopts a similar folded conformation also in solution. The study was made using VT-NMR, XRD and computational methods.

## Research at ICIQ

<Calendar/> May 2018 - April 2019

Enjoying the hospitality of Prof. Pau Ballester in his lab at the Institute of Chemical Research of Catalonia. The inspiring research atmosphere and instrumentation are just perfect for calix[4]pyrrole chemistry.

## Overview

<Calendar/> May 2018 - April 2023

The project aims to offer pioneering solutions for the selective binding of biologically and technologically important anions. The target anions include anti-inflammatory drugs with carboxylate groups, and valuable resources, such as phosphate and precious metals (Au, Pt, Co). The project focuses on advanced synthesis of selective receptors, characterization of the anion complexes and development of extraction methods for target anions from water.

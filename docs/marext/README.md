## First paper accepted in Chemistry - A European Journal

<Calendar/> February 2020

Małgorzata Pamuła, Maija Nissinen, Kaisa Helttunen, [Correlating solution- and solid-state structures of conformationally flexible resorcinarenes: significance of a sulfonyl group in intramolecular self‐inclusion](https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.201905211)

<Portrait src="17.png" alt="Chem. Eur. J. 2020" />

In this paper we show that a conformationally flexible resorcinarene macrocycle forms a self-inclusion complex in the solid state and adopts a similar folded conformation also in solution. The study was made using VT-NMR, XRD and computational methods.

## Research at ICIQ

<Calendar/> May 2018 - April 2019

Enjoying the hospitality of Prof. Pau Ballester in his lab at the Institute of Chemical Research of Catalonia. The inspiring research atmosphere and instrumentation are just perfect for calix[4]pyrrole chemistry.

## Overview

<Calendar/> May 2018 - April 2023

The project aims to offer pioneering solutions for the selective binding of biologically and technologically important anions. The target anions include anti-inflammatory drugs with carboxylate groups, and valuable resources, such as phosphate and precious metals (Au, Pt, Co). The project focuses on advanced synthesis of selective receptors, characterization of the anion complexes and development of extraction methods for target anions from water.

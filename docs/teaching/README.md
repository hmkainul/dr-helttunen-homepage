### Content
In this course several advanced nano-sized systems are provided and their properties are studied with various experimental methods. Each theme contains a short introduction lecture after which laboratory work is followed for 1-4 days. Most of the nano-sized systems are provided either by means of supramolecular chemical or nanobiological methods. The last day of the week is assigned for writing the report. From each theme a report will be written. After all written reports, a seminar-day is organized where the exercises are discussed one more time. 
In supramolecular chemistry exercise we prepare a nanomaterial by crystallizing metal-organic framework from a cyclodextrin and an alkali metal salt. We study the crystals with X-ray diffraction and visualise the crystal structure with Mercury software. In addition, we investigate the thermodynamic stability of a cyclodextrin-dye inclusion complex with fluorescence titration.

### Content 

#### Learning outcomes
After passing this course the student has an overview about nanoscience. He/she recognizes the size-classes and the main properties of nano-objects. He/she will learn fundamentals of the theoretical and experimental techniques in nanoscience. After the course, he/she has a clear picture about scientific literature in nanoscience and he/she can fluently provide short concise presentations from various themes in nanoscience.

#### Content
The course is taught by specialists from fields of physics, chemistry and biology. Introduction of the general ideas and concepts of nanoscience. Topics include physical, chemical and biological aspects of nanoscience and nanotechnology.

#### Completion methods
Every week includes 2-3 h lectures plus one optional hour for discussion. The course contains teamwork sessions, where students presents their findings on given topics in teams. Students also write essays about given topics about nano science. An estimated time for the home work is 8 h weekly. An exam takes place at the end of the course.

#### Assessment details
Accepted grade requires the basic knowledge from the nano sciences.The essays and team-works for each student will be evaluated individually. The weight of the exam is 50% of the whole grade.

#### Prerequisites
Basic knowledge from physics, chemistry and biology.

#### Course material
Material distributed at the lectures, plus the students participate in preparation of the study-material.



## Nanolaboratories 2020

### Course details
**Nanolaboratories, Molecular interactions NANA2001**<br>
**Time:** 13.1.2020–27.3.2020 <br>
**Credits:** 6 ECTS<br>
**Evaluation:** General scale, 0-5<br>
**Responsible teacher:** Prof. Janne Ihalainen<br>
**Registration:** [Sisu](https://sisu.jyu.fi/student/courseunit/jy-CU-41919-v2/brochure)

### Content
The course is divided in four blocks. In each block, different nano-sized system is studied from physics, biology or chemistry perspective. In supramolecular chemistry block we prepare a nanomaterial by crystallizing metal-organic framework from a cyclodextrin and an alkali metal salt. We study the crystals with X-ray diffraction and visualise the crystal structure with Mercury software. In addition, we investigate the thermodynamic stability of a cyclodextrin-dye inclusion complex with fluorescence titration.

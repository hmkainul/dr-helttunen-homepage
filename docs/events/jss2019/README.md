### Contents 
Practical aspects for characterization of intermolecular interactions in supramolecular complexes using spectroscopic techniques and isothermal titration calorimetry. The topics include geometrical characterization of complex structures (mainly NMR experiments), thermodynamic characterization (spectroscopic titrations and isothermal titration calorimetry), and kinetic characterizarion (fast and slow exchange binding processes on the NMR timescales, EXSY, complete bandshape analysis). During practical sessions example data is processed and analysed using freely available software, therefore, bringing your own laptop is recommended. Participants are invited to bring their own samples or data for measurement and analysis during practical sessions (optional).

### Learning outcomes
The student will learn basic concepts of supramolecular binding and the structural characterization of supramolecular complexes in solution. The student will understand what kind of information can be extracted from NMR and optical spectroscopy titrations, as well as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments. The student will learn to select the appropriate range of concentrations to perform titration experiments based on the expected magnitude of the binding constants to be determined. The student will be acquainted with basic NMR experiments addressed to the kinetic characterization of supramolecular systems. The student will be familiarized with methods for the treatment and analysis of titration data, as well as those produced by the kinetic characterization experiments.

### Prerequisites
The student knows basic concepts of supramolecular chemistry, different types of weak intermolecular interactions, and basic operating principles of NMR and optical spectroscopy.


### Lecturer
[Prof. Pablo Ballester](http://www.iciq.org/research/research_group/prof-pau-ballester/) is an ICREA Research Professor and a Group Leader at ICIQ (Institute of Chemical Research of Catalonia). His research is mainly focused in the design, synthesis, study and characterization of functional molecular aggregates. Pablo Ballester has worked in many renowned universities and institutes in Spain and in USA, including Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, USA) as a postdoctoral associate and at the Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, USA) with the rank of associate professor of research.

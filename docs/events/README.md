## Researchers' Night 2019

### What can you do with nanosugar?

 Our group has prepared a demonstration that shows how a lipophilic dye changes it colour when it is encapsulated inside a macrocyclic host, cyclodextrin ("nanosugar"). The demonstration gives a visual experience on a basic concept studied in supramolecular chemistry, the formation of a host-guest complex by weak interactions between two molecular species. We also look at the nanoporous crystals these sugars form when they organize into metal-organic frameworks with alkali metal cations (potassium, rubidium) and how the pores can be used to encapsulate the dye inside the crystal. 
 The demonstration is part of the [Nanoscience demonstrations](https://www.jyu.fi/en/academic-events/researchers-night/programme-2019/at-ylistonrinne) that take place 27.9.2019 in the University of Jyväskylä, at Ylistönrinne campus.
